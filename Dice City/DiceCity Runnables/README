INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAUNCHING THE APPLICATION:

1.  Launch the Server jar file first.  Regardless of whether the game will be played alone or with more than one person, the server is
    needed for the game to run.
    
2.  Once the server is running or waiting, then the game client jar file can be executed.  The default port (which is hard-coded into the 
    server code as of the writing of this README) is 1331.  Make sure this port is open and accessable to the application on the network
    it is being launched on.
    
3.  Once the game client is launched, you will be prompted for an IP and a Port.  Enter the IPv4 address of the device running the server
    application, and the port 1331.  If the game client connects successfully, the text will change to display your player number, and a 
    successful connection.  NOTE: only one player needs to run the server tool per game!
    
4.  Once all desired players have connected (there is a maximum of 4), only one player needs to press the Start Game button to launch the
    game.  After a moment, the game screen should appear, and the first player should be able to right click on their dice and use location
    abilities.
    
All actions in the game are made via mouse clicks.  To use dice, simply right click them and select an option (only location abilities are
currently implemented).  To attack a bandit or buy a location during the appropriate steps, simply left click the cards.  Resources should
be updated accordingly.  Newly bought locations (excluding harvest locations and regular armies) will disappear from the market and be put
into a stack.  The player then can left click on any location in their city to replace it with the first location in the stack.  There is
no indicator at first of who's turn it is, other than the ability to use dice.  As the game progresses, your dice will become visible once 
it is your turn to play.
